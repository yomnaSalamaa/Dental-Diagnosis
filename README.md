# 🦷 Dental X-ray Diagnosis System
===

# 

# This project is a deep learning-based Dental X-ray Diagnosis Web App built using \*\*YOLOv8 models\*\*, \*\*Streamlit\*\*, and a \*\*local SQLite database\*\*. It detects \*\*individual teeth\*\* and \*\*dental diseases\*\* from panoramic X-ray images, and provides a \*\*PDF report\*\* of the findings.

# 

# \## 📌 Features

# 

# \- 🦷 \*\*Teeth Detection\*\*  

# &nbsp; Detects and labels each tooth in the X-ray using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.

# 

# \- ❗ \*\*Disease Detection\*\*  

# &nbsp; Identifies dental diseases such as \*Impacted Tooth\* using a second YOLOv8 model.

# 

# \- 📝 \*\*Combined Detection Mode\*\*  

# &nbsp; Runs both models and shows combined output.

# 

# \- 🖼️ \*\*Image Upload\*\*  

# &nbsp; Users can upload X-ray images and receive visual results.

# 

# \- 🧾 \*\*PDF Report Generation\*\*  

# &nbsp; Generates downloadable PDF reports with detection results and annotated X-ray images.

# 

# \- 📁 \*\*Diagnosis History\*\*  

# &nbsp; Users can view their previous diagnoses saved locally in a database.

# 

# \- 🔒 \*\*Login/Signup System\*\*  

# &nbsp; Authenticated access with Streamlit login for personal report history.
